when you think about creating discord music bot, you think about samething complicated like ytdl or scdl!.
so here you go `music.kyp` make those hard function with simple thing like:

```js
<music-kyp.player>.play(<Discord.Message | Discord.ICommand>, <song name/url>)
```

cool right?, what if i told you you can make better and better
